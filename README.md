This geographic visualization displays **profit distribution across US states**, with:
- **Bubble size** representing **sales volume**
- **Color intensity** showing **profit levels**

**Key Insights**:
- **California** and **New York** lead in both **profit and sales**.
- States like **Texas**, **Colorado**, **Illinois**, and **Ohio** are notable for **negative profits**, despite decent sales‚Äîindicating potential inefficiencies or pricing issues.
- There‚Äôs a need to investigate underperforming regions (e.g., **Texas** at -$25,729) for strategic adjustments.

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0ddf4901-7aeb-4452-a397-e046733fa065)

This bar chart breaks down **sales and profits** by:
- **Category** (Furniture, Office Supplies, Technology)
- **Sub-Category** (e.g., Chairs, Tables, Phones)

**Color Scale**:
- Blue = High Profit
- Orange = Losses

**Key Insights**:
- **Chairs**, **Phones**, and **Binders** generate **high sales and profits**.
- **Tables** and **Bookcases** show **high sales but negative profit**, suggesting poor margin management or over-discounting.
- **Technology sub-categories** generally outperform others, especially **Phones** and **Accessories**.
- Sub-categories like **Supplies**, **Tables**, and **Bookcases** should be evaluated for cost optimization.

## üìå Summary & Recommendations

- Optimize pricing and cost strategy for high-sales but low-profit items (e.g., Tables).
- Investigate loss-heavy states like Texas and Illinois for potential logistic or operational issues.
- Consider inventory and promotion strategies for Technology products given their strong seasonal performance.
- Rebalance marketing focus away from low-performing sub-categories toward higher ROI areas like Phones and Accessories.
